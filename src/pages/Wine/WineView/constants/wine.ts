    "So I decided to make a festive meal in Italian style, the meal started with beef fillet carpaccio with radish slices and reduced balsamic, lettuce salad with cherry tomatoes, purple onion in honey and mustard, cherry tomato salad and balsamic mozzarella bib, antipasti, green. Tapestry of olives, artichokes, pesto and basil from crispy focaccia spread, later we took out a rare seafood fillet spiced with herbs and olive oil accompanied by cheese ravioli, spinach ricotta ravioli with parmesan, and if already.
